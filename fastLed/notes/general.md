WLED vs FastLED
FastLED is a low level library to be able to directly control strips of LEDS.
WLED is more of a UI for LEDS to be able to connect and control LEDS using an ESP32 or ESP8266 controller. WLED acomes with lots of builtin animations and functions out of the box and uses FastLED under the hood.
Maybe it would be easiest to use WLED to control the lights as it already has many patterns and wifi connectivity built in.
